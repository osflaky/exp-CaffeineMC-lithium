/**
 * Optimizing redstone dust is tricky, but even more so if you wish to preserve behavior
 * perfectly. There are two big reasons redstone wire is laggy:
 * <br>
 * - It updates recursively. Each wire updates its power level in isolation, rather than
 * in the context of the network it is a part of. This means each wire in a network
 * could check and update its power level over half a dozen times. This also leads to
 * way more shape and block updates than necessary.
 * <br>
 * - It emits copious amounts of duplicate and redundant shape and block updates. While
 * the recursive updates are largely to blame, even a single state change leads to 18
 * redundant block updates and up to 16 redundant shape updates.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately fixing either of these aspects can be detected in-game, even if it is
 * through obscure mechanics. Removing redundant block updates can be detected with
 * something as simple as a redstone wire on a trapdoor, while removing the recursive
 * updates can be detected with locational setups that rely on a specific block update
 * order.
 * 
 * <p>
 * What we can optimize, however, are the power calculations. In vanilla, these are split
 * into two parts:
 * <br>
 * - Power from non-wire components.
 * <br>
 * - Power from other redstone wires.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For the default evaluator, we can combine the two to reduce calls to Level.getBlockState
 * and BlockState.isRedstoneConductor as well as calls to BlockState.getSignal and
 * BlockState.getDirectSignal. We can avoid calling those last two methods on redstone wires
 * altogether, since we know they should return 0.
 * <br>
 * These changes can lead to a mspt reduction of up to 20% on top of Lithium's other
 * performance improvements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The experimental evaluator actually uses the wire-power and non-wire-power separately,
 * so we can't combine them. We can, however, optimize each individually, with the same
 * principles.
